                            The world famous MudeMeter rating represents the percentage of positive professional reviews for films and TV shows and is
                            used by millions every day, to help with their entertainment viewing decisions. Mude designates the best reviewed movies

                            The MudeMeter rating - based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics - is a trusted measurement
                            of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.

                            The MudeMeter rating represents the percentage of professional critic reviews that are positive for a given film or television

                            Back in the days of the open theaters, 
                            when a play was particularly atrocious, 
                            the audience expressed their dissatisfaction
                            by not only booing and hissing at the stage, 
                            but throwing whatever was at hand -- vegetables and fruits included.

                                 To receive a Guaranteed Pick rating a movie must have a steady MudeMeter rating of 75% or better. Movies opening in wide
                                release need at least 80 reviews from MudeMeter Critics (including 5 Top Critics). Movies opening in limited release need
                                at least 40 reviews from MudeMeter Critics (including 5 Top Critics). A TV show must have a MudeMeter Score of 75% or
                                better with 20 or more reviews from MudeMeter Critics (including 5 Top Critics). If the MudeMeter score drops below 70%,
                                then the movie or TV show loses its Certified Fresh status. In some cases, the Certified Fresh designation may be held at
                                the discretion of the Rotten MudeMeter editorial team.
